HTML Portfolio Assignment
Overview
In this assignment, you will create a personal HTML portfolio page from scratch.
You’ll build a simple webpage with information about yourself and expand it with some additional HTML features.
You will turn in a link to your GitHub Pages site on Canvas when finished.

Instructions
1. Set Up
Create a new GitHub repository for this project.

Create an index.html file in your repository.

Enable GitHub Pages on your repository (Settings → Pages → Source: main branch → Save).
This will give you a URL where your page is hosted.

2. Build Your HTML Page
Your page should include:

A title (your name) in a heading tag (<h1>).

At least one image (use the <img> tag).

At least one link to an external site (your GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.), using <a>.

Make it open in a new tab.

At least one bullet point list (<ul> with <li>).

At least one numbered list (<ol> with <li>).

One centered heading (use inline CSS or center using a block element).

An input box (<input>) and a button (<button>).

A link to another HTML page within your project.

(You'll need to create at least one additional .html file.)

3. Extra Features (Stretch Goals)
If you want to go beyond the basics:

Add some CSS to style your page (colors, fonts, layout, etc.).

Expand your content with more sections (projects, skills, contact info, etc.).

4. Submission
When you are done:

Make sure your GitHub Pages site is live.

Turn in the GitHub Pages link on Canvas.
